# Train Times

This project contains a Discord app written in JavaScript. The goal of the app is to check the upcoming departing trains from Arnhem Presikhaaf.

## Project structure

Below is a basic overview of the project structure:

```
├── .env.sample -> sample .env file
├── app.js      -> main entrypoint for app
├── commands.js -> slash command payloads + helpers
├── utils.js    -> utility functions and enums
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

## Running the app locally

Before you start, you'll need to [create a Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the proper permissions:

-   `applications.commands`
-   `bot` (with Send Messages enabled)

Configuring the app is covered in detail in the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

### Setup project

First clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/IkBenDeSjaak/discord-train-times.git
```

Then navigate to its directory and install dependencies:

```
cd discord-train-times
npm install
```

### Get app credentials

Fetch the credentials from your app's settings and add them to a `.env` file (see `.env.sample` for an example). You'll need your app ID (`APP_ID`), server ID (`GUILD_ID`), bot token (`DISCORD_TOKEN`), and public key (`PUBLIC_KEY`).

### Run the app

After your credentials are added, go ahead and run the app:

```
node app.js
```

### Set up interactivity

The project needs a public endpoint where Discord can send requests to. To develop and test locally, you can use something like [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel HTTP traffic.

Install ngrok if you haven't already, then start listening on port `3000`:

```
ngrok http 3000
```

You should see your connection open:

```
Tunnel Status                 online
Version                       2.0/2.0
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    http://1234-someurl.ngrok.io -> localhost:3000
Forwarding                    https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io -> localhost:3000

Connections                  ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

Copy the forwarding address that starts with `https`, in this case `https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io`, then go to your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

On the **General Information** tab, there will be an **Interactions Endpoint URL**. Paste your ngrok address there, and append `/interactions` to it (`https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io/interactions` in the example).

Click **Save Changes**, and your app should be ready to run 🚀
